    title: "Hosted the Biggest DAO Event in Uyo with Mprofy",
    description: `<div>Taget proudly hosted what they’ve dubbed the "biggest DAO event in Uyo" during Q1 2025. This event marks a significant milestone for the project, showcasing its ability to mobilize a community, foster collaboration, and spotlight decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in a region that might not traditionally be seen as a hub for such cutting-edge concepts.
